## 💡 About Me

I am a passionate tech educator and founder with a mission to **bridge the gap between school-level education and real-world technology skills**. With academic training from the University of Moratuwa and hands-on experience in startups, IoT labs, and global certifications, I've built programs that empower students through:

- **Project-based learning**
- **Affordable access to hardware/software**
- **Certification-backed outcomes**

This proposal outlines two scalable, high-impact educational initiatives designed for different age groups — both aiming to inspire future engineers, developers, and innovators.

## 🔹 Proposal 1: TechSpark Junior  
### Hands-On Intro to Programming, IoT, Robotics & Arduino for School Students

> 📌 *Ideal for Grades 5–A/L students*

### Key Features:
- **Modular 3-month program** split into Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced levels
- Each student receives their own **Arduino kit** (retained after course)
- Project-based curriculum: LED blinkers ➜ Smart irrigation systems ➜ Line-following robots
- **Demo Day + Certificate** at the end
- Optional online lessons and quiz system

### Why Invest?
✅ Builds early technical confidence  
✅ Affordable kits and flexible pricing  
✅ Scalable across schools and districts  
✅ Strong marketing strategy using demos, digital ads, and teacher partnerships

## 🔹 Proposal 2: A/L ICT Programming Mastery Course  
### Python, Web Development & Practical Coding for GCE A/L Students

> 📌 *Aligned with Sri Lanka’s A/L ICT syllabus*

### Key Features:
- **12-week structured course** covering:
  - **Python programming** (core logic, OOP, DB integration)
  - **Web development basics**: HTML, CSS, PHP, SQL
  - **Optional Arduino module** for embedded systems exposure
- Hands-on projects like login systems, CRUD apps, mini quiz games
- Final **project presentation day + certificate**
- Optional Arduino kit (~2500 LKR extra)

### Why Invest?
✅ Directly supports A/L ICT practicals  
✅ Prepares students for university or freelance tech careers  
✅ High demand among A/L students seeking job-ready skills  
✅ Profitable per batch (20 students = ~100,000+ LKR revenue)
