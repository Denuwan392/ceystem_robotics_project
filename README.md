## 🔹 1. Introduction

![Robotics Education](b1ac14ace68615b8d1e05bff440e4665.jpg)

*Young students engaging in hands-on tech learning*

We propose to launch a **3-month short-term educational program** to introduce school students (Grade 5 and above) to **Programming, IoT, and Robotics** through interactive, project-based learning using custom-built **Arduino kits**. Upon completion, each student will receive a **certificate** and showcase their projects at a **Demo Day**.

This initiative aims to **nurture creativity, critical thinking**, and build early-stage technical confidence in young minds.

## 🔹 2. Objectives

- Deliver foundational tech education using a **hands-on, project-based approach**
- Offer **flexible course structures** suitable for different age groups
- Conduct **workshops and school demos** to increase engagement and awareness
- Provide **affordable kits and certifications** for each student

---

## 🔹 3. Target Audience

- **Primary Group:** Grade 5 – A/L students  
- **Secondary Group:** Tech clubs, coding clubs, and rural outreach initiatives  
- **Batch Size:** 20–30 students per session

## 🔹 4. Course Flow (Flexible & Modular)

| Level | Focus Areas | Tools / Projects |
|-------|-------------|------------------|
| **Beginner (G5–8)** | Scratch, Tinkercad, Arduino Basics | LED blink, buzzer alarm, water sensor |
| **Intermediate (G9–11)** | Python, Serial Monitor, sensors, motors | Bluetooth car, smart light system |
| **Advanced (G12–A/L)** | Full project builds, intro to IoT & AI | Line-following robot, smart irrigation |

- **12-week course** (1–2 sessions/week, 1.5–2 hours per session)
- Every student works hands-on with a real **Arduino kit**
- **End-of-course Certificate + Demo Day**
